#### Steps to take

-   You should provide the documents related to the ethical approval. Think of the approval letter from the ethical committee, a blank consent form, and the ethics application text for your project.
-   Make sure the files are saved in a [sustainable file format](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats/){target="_blank"}. This can be a .pdf or .odt file.
-   Provide the documents with a good file name (use the [three principles for file naming described in this presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7551576){target="_blank"}) and save it in the `documentation` folder.
