This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs){target="_blank"}. This workshop is currently (Summer 2024) under construction. We plan to run a first pilot of the workshop in Autumn 2024.

## Welcome

Welcome to the online materials for the *Prepare your publication package* workshop! This course is offered at the [Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities (EGSH)](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/){target="_blank"} at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/){target="_blank"} in the Netherlands. But these online materials are free to use for anyone who wants to learn more about publication packages, research data management, and reproducible research. The materials are also shared under a [CC-BY license](LICENSE.md), for others who want to re-use, share or adapt part of the materials in their own courses.

::: questions
-   What is a publication package?
-   What is needed to prepare a publication package for my research project?

::: objectives
After completion of this workshop, you will be able to:

-   Explain the components of a publication package
-   Apply best practices to document, organize, share, and archive your research data
-   Produce a publication package for your own research project
-   Determine which parts of the package need to be published and which parts need to be archived internally
-   Find available information and support for completing a publication package

## About the course

Researchers that disseminate their research results in publications such as journal articles, should ensure that it is clear to others what data the research was based on, how the data were obtained, how results were achieved, and that the steps in the research process are verifiable. 
The [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} describes how this should be achieved by creating a so-called publication package for each publication. 
Such a publication package must contain all information needed to validate the results presented in a publication, such as the raw and processed data, the documentation of qualitative data production processes, and the computer codes used to process and analyze the data.
In other words, a publication package consists of all data, materials and information that are needed to replicate, reproduce, and assess the published research results.

Publication packages are mandatory for all research produced at the Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences. 
But the structured way of documenting and archiving research data and materials in a publication package is arguably beneficial for all researchers.
The most important reason to create publication packages is that you and your co-authors or colleagues will still have access to the data and know which important steps were taken during the research after the project has ended. 
Increasingly, researchers are expected to make their research data and materials available, in such a way that it is *as open as possible and as closed as necessary*. 
Publishing (parts of the) publication package itself allows others to verify and replicate your research and re-use your materials. 

In this workshop, we will dive into the different components of a publication package by looking at an example package.
But most importantly, you are expected to bring your own data and materials and get started with creating a publication package for your own project. 
By working together with your peers during the workshop, you will receive immediate feedback on the usability and clarity of the your package components for others.
There will also be ample opportunity to ask questions to the instructors of the course, who are experts in research data management.

After completing this course, you will have created a first version of a publication package for your own research project and you will be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to finish the package independently.
