:::

::: objectives
-   Include all instructions, procedures, experiment design and stimulus materials in your publication package
-   Apply best practices for file names and file formats
-   Clearly describe all files and procedures

In this step you need to include instructions, procedures, the design of the experiment and stimulus materials (interview guide, questionnaires, surveys, tests) necessary to replicate the research.

#### Steps to take

-   According to the instructions in the [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} (p.8) you should include:
    -   "The instructions, procedures, the design of the experiment and stimulus materials (interview guide, questionnaires, surveys, tests) that can reasonably be deemed necessary in order to replicate the research. The materials must be available in the language in which the research was conducted. The publication package must be in English."
-   Make sure all files are saved in a [sustainable file format](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats/){target="_blank"}, and that the files are [properly named](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7551576){target="_blank"}). In case you work with sub folders, save the files in the `materials` folder.
-   Make sure that all files and procedures are clearly described and self-explanatory

#### Example files

See the codebook and the questionnaire in the `materials` folder from the [EUR publication package example repository on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7956600){target="_blank"}:

Other examples you can think of:

-   Protocols for interviews or focus groups.

    -   The [SOPs4RI](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E9U8T){target="_blank"} project has made the protocol for their focus group study available on [their OSF page](https://osf.io/kdtnx){target="_blank"}.

    -   [Hoogsteder (2020)](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-2c6-4rfd){target="_blank"} has shared their interview protocol on the [DANS Data Station Life Sciences](https://lifesciences.datastations.nl/file.xhtml?fileId=13264&version=2.0&toolType=PREVIEW){target="_blank"}.
