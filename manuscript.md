::: checklist
#### Steps to take

-   According to the instructions in the [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} (p.8) you should include the published (or accepted) manuscript or publication in your package.
-   Additionally, it is stated that you "must include a brief description of the problem definition, research design, data collection (sampling, selection and representativeness of informants) and methods used. An electronic version of the published manuscript will generally suffice."
    -   Check that your manuscript contains this information.
-   Make sure the manuscript is saved in a [sustainable file format](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats/){target="_blank"}, most likely a .pdf.
-   In case your manuscript is not yet finished or accepted, wait with including the manuscript until the publication is accepted and/or finalized.
