The first component that we will add to the package is number 7 in our [list of publication package components](introduction.Rmd##the-contents-of-a-publication-package): the data management plan.

#### Steps to take

-   You should simply provide a copy of the most recent version of your data management plan.
-   Make sure it is saved in a [sustainable file format](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats/){target="_blank"}. This can be a .pdf or .odt file. If you have your most recent version in [dmponline](https://dmponline.eur.nl/){target="_blank"}, you can download it to your computer in pdf or an alternative format using the `Download` tab.
-   Provide the document with a good file name (use the [three principles for file naming described in this presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7551576){target="_blank"}) and save it in the `documentation` folder.
-   It is also a good moment to take a look at the contents of your data management plan: is it still up to date? Do you need to take more steps to put it into practice?
