This is a mock readme file that was created on 2023-04-12 by EUR Research Data Stewards. 

It serves as an example for how a publication package could look like based on the Guideline (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831) for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands (but might be useful for other disciplines and countries as well).
Dataset used in this example is the SAFI Survey Results: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6262019.v4
The original dataset was generated by Philip Woodhouse, Gert Jan Veldwisch, Daniel Brockington, Hans C. Komakech, Angela Manjichi, Jean-Philippe Venot

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: The original survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset.
