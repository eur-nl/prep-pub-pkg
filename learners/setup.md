## Data Sets

### Instructions

1.  Download the `eur-publication-package.zip` file from the [EUR publication package example repository on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7956600){target="_blank"} and unzip it to your Desktop or Home directory. This is an example publication package that we will use throughout the workshop
2.  Create a new directory for a research project that you need to create a publication package for. This can be a recent publication or manuscript that you have sent out to a journal. If possible, use a project for which you have already collected, processed and analyzed the data and drafted a manuscript.
    i.  Create a similar folder structure for your own project as in the example publication package downloaded at step 1: create folders called `data`, `data_output`, `documentation`, `materials`, and `scripts`.
    ii. Try to copy as much elements of the publication package from your own project into the folders. For example, raw data in the `data` folder, processed data in the `data_output` folder, data management plan and ethics documentation in the `documentation` folder, blank questionnaires and other stimulus materials as well as codebooks in the `materials` folders, and computer code or syntax in the `scripts` folder. This will get you started with your own publication package. Don't worry if it is not yet complete or tidy. You will work on improving your package during and after the workshop.
