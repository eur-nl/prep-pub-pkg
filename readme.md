#### Steps to take

-   According to the instructions in the [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} (p.9) you should include a "readme file (metadata) describing which documents and files can be found where and how they should be interpreted". A specific list of information that the readme file should contain is also provided:
    -   Name of the person who stored the documents or files
    -   Division of roles among authors, indicating at least who analysed the data
    -   Date on which the manuscript was accepted, including reference
    -   Date/period of data collection
    -   Names of people who collected the data
    -   If relevant: addresses of field locations where data were collected and contact persons (if any)
    -   Whether or not an ethical assessment took place before the research, and, if relevant, study reference from and statements made by the Ethics Review Committee
    -   Whether the data is made open or not and if not, a valid reason for not opening up the data
-   Make sure you make the readme file in plain text, using a text editor, like Notepad/TextEdit/Vim, **not** Word (save as .txt). Alternatively, if you feel comfortable with Markdown, you can use the Markdown format (.md)

Other examples that you can use to get started with a readme:

-   The [Cornell guide to writing “readme” style metadata](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/readme/){target="_blank"} is a very helpful resource that includes a good readme template

-   Colleagues from Leiden University provide a [specific readme template based on the Guideline for archiving for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7113206)

::: challenge
## README exercise

Share your draft README with a colleague or with your neighbor during the workshop.

-   Ask your peer to read through your README

-   Can they answer the following questions based on the document:

    -   Is it clear when and where the research took place?

    -   Will they know where to find specific files when aiming to reproduce results?

    -   Do they know what specific software to use?

    -   Which improvements do they suggest to make the README as clear as possible?
