## Why create a publication package?

### Compliance with guidelines and policies

First and foremost, the inevitable reason to create a publication package is that is a way to comply with (inter)national guidelines and policies for good academic practice:

### Guidelines and policies

-   All researchers in the Netherlands should adhere to the [Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-2cj-nvwu){target="_blank"}, which describes that it should be clear to others what data the research was based on, how the data were obtained, what and how results were achieved, and that the steps in the research process must be verifiable.
-   Similarly, The [The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://www.doi.org/10.26356/ECOC){target="_blank"} requires that researchers share their results in an open, honest, transparent, and accurate manner and that they preserve all data, metadata, protocols, code, software, and other research materials appropriately.
-   The [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} describes how this should be achieved by creating a so-called publication package for each publication.
-   At a University level, the [Research Data Management Policy](https://doi.org/10.25397/eur.16912120.v1){target="_blank"} of Erasmus University Rotterdam dictates that data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use.
-   Additionally, there are also very similar requirements from funders (see for example the [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-data-management){target="_blank"} and [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/manage-your-project/open-science){target="_blank"} policies on research data management) and journals (see for example the [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability){target="_blank"} and [Nature portfolio journals](https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/reporting-standards){target="_blank"} policies on data availability)
:::

The conclusion that follows from the (non-exhaustive) list of guidelines and policies above is that as a researcher, you are required to clearly document your whole research process, store it in a safe place and make it publicly available whenever possible (as open as possible and as closed as necessary). By creating a publication package for your published research results, you will end up with a structured bundle detailing everything that is needed to verify and replicate the results published in a specific manuscript.

::: discussion
Some questions to discuss with your peers:

-   Which of the above policies and guidelines are familiar to you?

-   To what extent do you currently comply with those guidelines?

-   Which extra steps do you need to take to increase compliance?

### Benefits for you and your colleagues

#### Documentation for your future self

Imagine you are going to reuse your data in a week, a month, a year, or even in 10 years time. Then it is very important that you will document your data thoroughly, because you will not remember all details about the data. And be aware: your past self doesnâ€™t answer emails! Well-documented data helps you to remember and understand all the details even many years later (but it might be useful sooner as well).

#### Documentation for collaborators and re-usability

Well-documented data also helps others to use the data. When you collaborate with others in a research project, good documentation and metadata will save you countless emails and meetings to explain the details about the data. This is also the case when you are planning to make your data available for re-use. In that case, you want your dataset to be self-explanatory, in such a way that others can use it independently.

#### Documentation to smoothly work with data

In addition, properly annotated data also helps you to complete rote tasks faster and help you make fewer errors. If you know exactly what data is where and files and variables are named unambiguously, you can avoid mistakes and you can more easily automate data processing tasks.

## The contents of a publication package

In the infographic above, the contents of a publication package as described in the [Guideline for the archiving of academic research for Faculties of Behavioural and Social Sciences in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7583831){target="_blank"} are summarized. For your convenience, we also list the components below in textual form:

::: checklist
1.  **Manuscript or publication**
    -   Must include a brief description of the problem definition, research design, data collection (sampling, selection and representativeness of informants) and methods used
2.  **Materials used**
    -   Include instructions, procedures, the design of the experiment and stimulus materials (interview guide, questionnaires, surveys, tests) necessary to replicate the research
3.  **Raw data files**
    -   Provide the most direct registration of behaviour or reactions of participants. Think of unfiltered export files of surveys, EEG measurements, recordings or transcripts. If needed, include all de-identification steps taken
4.  **Preprocessing computer code**
    -   Include code (such as Atlas.Ti/SPSS/JASP syntax files, R scripts, etc.) describing the steps taken to process raw data into analysis data, including brief explanations of the steps in English
5.  **Processed data files**
    -   Provide data (either raw or processed) that were eventually analysed when preparing the article (e.g. a data file after transforming variables, after applying selection, etc.). If the raw data was analysed directly, step 3 suffices
6.  **Analysis computer code**
    -   Include code describing the steps taken to process the analysis data into the results reported in the manuscript, including brief explanations of the steps in English
7.  **Data management plan**
    -   Provide a copy of the most recent version of your data management plan
8.  **Readme file**
    -   Provide a clear readme describing who was involved in the project, when the data was collected, which documents and files can be found where and how to interpret them
9.  **Ethics documentation**
    -   Documents related to the ethical approval (e.g. approval letter, blank consent form)

In the second part of the workshop, we will look into the different components of a publication package in more detail. 
The [EUR publication package example](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7956600){target="_blank"} that you downloaded to your computer (see [data sets section on the setup page](setup.md#data-sets)) provides examples for all of the components.
Additionally, in most cases you will hopefully have some components ready at hand (e.g., a data management plan) and you can immediately add it to your draft publication package.
